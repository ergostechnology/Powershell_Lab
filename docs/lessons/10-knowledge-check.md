# Your Turn

Congratulations, you've survived!

Now it's time to put what we've discussed to use. You can use NinjaRMM to access the PowerShell prompt on computers in the "ERGOS - Powershell Lab" client environment. It was built just for this!

## Get a User

1. User PowerShell to find the user with the account JKrellin. 
2. Note their first name
3. Note their e-mail address

## Create a User

1. User PowerShell to create a user in the testUsers OU
2. Name the user after yourself

## Update a User

1. Using the user you just created, use PowerShell to update extensionAttribute10
2. Say Hello!

## Conditionals

1. Get any user account
2. Use an if block to determine if the account is active or inactive
3. If the account is active, make disable it
4. If the account is disabled, enable it

## Loops

1. Get all users in the labUsers OU
2. How many users are there in total (Hint: a variable and the Count method will help)
3. Iterate through the loop to find the users who work in the Hoth office. How many users work from Hoth?
