# Why PowerShell?

## It's Already There

The overwhelming majority of the devices we support are Windows based. Windows comes with PowerShell installed by default. 

It's a no-brainer.

## It's Cross-Platform

While there is some nuance in the differences between PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 6+ (Core), *in general* you can write scripts on any platform, and likewise run them anywhere. 

## It's Object Oriented

Not all shell environments are created equally. PowerShell is built around .NET objects, which allows for advanced programming techniques.
