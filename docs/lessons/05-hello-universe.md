# Hello Universe!

```powershell
Write-Host "Hello World."
```

That's it. 

It's the first thing you learn in most programming languages. "How do I print the words 'Hello World.' to the screen?". 

You could make it a little more complicated:

```powershell
$hola = "Hello World."

$hola
```

Technically `write-output` would work:

```powershell
Write-Output "Hello World."
```

But it might not be best.
